## Improve SEO

#### 1. Good Content
###### Engage User In First Seconds
If users enter your site, they should be engaged from what they see.
- Catchy headline
- Clear UI
  
###### Hold Users On The Site
- Interesting and good written content
- Clear Text (Try not to use endless text blocks)
- Images, animations
- Comprehensible structuring
- Stand Out Information (What will the user learn about? How long it takes? Who teaches them? How they will learn? Why is it important?)
- Good UX Design
Please don't try to keep people for hours with dumb making content, that's exploitation of human psychology!
